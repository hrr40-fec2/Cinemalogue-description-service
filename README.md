Cinemalogue

Item Overview Module
This service belongs on an item detail page for the app. It displays a summary overview of important details about the selected movie item at a glance, and gives the user a front and center location to perform some commonly used functions such as adding a rating to the movie, and potentially bookmarking it or navigating to related pages.

Navigate to the root directory, then
install dependencies: npm install
seed the database with fake movie data: npm run db:seed
run unit tests with npm test
start the server with npm start
